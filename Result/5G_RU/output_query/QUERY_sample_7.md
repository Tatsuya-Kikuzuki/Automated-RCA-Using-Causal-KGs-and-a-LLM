## Response (RAG)
### response 1 (RAG)
- ref 1 (RAG): [sentence0_6](#sentence0_6)
- response 1 (RAG): During the connection test, the DU stopped sending packets due to PTP getting unlocked. This was caused by a memory overload when the number of UE connections or throughput increased. To resolve it, exclusive control of PTP control and data processing was implemented. 
### response 2 (RAG)
- ref 2 (RAG): [sentence0_4](#sentence0_4)
- response 2 (RAG): No data was transmitted from DU because PTP and SyncE got unlocked. The issue was resolved by replacing the v1 SFP with v2 SFP, which successfully locked PTP and SyncE. The problem was a compatibility issue. 
### response 3 (RAG)
- ref 3 (RAG): [sentence0_5](#sentence0_5)
- response 3 (RAG): The DU failed to transmit data because PTP got unlocked. The issue was resolved by changing the PTP accuracy threshold from 80ns to 1420ns in v206 software. 
### response 4 (RAG)
- ref 4 (RAG): [sentence0_3](#sentence0_3)
- response 4 (RAG): CU-IP was not getting assigned in RU with v356 software, and PTP was getting unlocked. The issue was fixed with software v359, which cleared the PTP unlocked issue.

## sentence0_6
During the connection test, the DU stopped sending packets.
It was found that the PTP got unlocked.

When the number of UE connections or throughput increased, the process to handle those caused a memory overload and the PTP control program was in an error state. This caused issues.

The problem was addressed by implementing exlusive control of PTP control and data processing.
## sentence0_4
No Data was transmitted from DU.
It was observed that PTP and SyncE getting unlocked and those caused the incident.

According to 5gdulls logs, L1 was down. Need to check connection from DU to RU.

After replacing the v1 SFP with v2 SFP, PTP and SyncE got locked state successfully.
Here problem was not SFP itself, but it should be compatibility issue.
## sentence0_5
The DU failed to transmit data because PTP got unlocked.

We tried rebooting RU. Once RU is up, PTP gets locked and in 4 to 5 minutes goes unlocked state again, then no data is obserbed from DU.

Checked PTP accuracy and found that the PTP threshold for v201 software (Â±80 nsec) was too low, resulting in an unlocked state.
The issue was no longer observed after threshold of PTP accuracy was changed from 80ns to 1420ns in v206.

## sentence0_3
CU-IP was not getting assigned in RU with v356 software.
We observed PTP too was getting unlocked with v356 build.

5gdulls log shows "Software-Failure", which incicates the fact that RU could not catch the DHCP IP address correctly by the stacking of the software. In the v356 software, functionality of FQDN is developed partially and it conflicts with the DHCP function. It affects the PTP unlocked issue as well.

Issue has been fixed with software v359, Now CU-IP getting configured on RU and PTP unlocked issue cleared.

## sentence1_1
The UE connection was difficult to establish. In addition, the MCS assigned was low after connection.

On investigation, it was found that the RX sensitivity was normal, but the gain settings on the DU procured from the new vendor were incorrect. This caused poor channel quality at all times, and finally resulted in the incident described at the beginning.

When the gain settings were made correct, the problem was resolved.

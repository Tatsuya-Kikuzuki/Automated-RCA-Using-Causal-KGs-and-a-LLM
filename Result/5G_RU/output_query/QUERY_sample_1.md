## Response (RAG)
### response 1 (RAG)
- ref 1 (RAG): [sentence0_0](#sentence0_0)
- response 1 (RAG): Throughput was not enough on UEs during test experiments. To resolve it, moving UEs to a different location resolved the issue, as the initial field's terrain and UE's antenna configurations were susceptible to frequency selectivity. 
### response 2 (RAG)
- ref 2 (RAG): [sentence0_2](#sentence0_2)
- response 2 (RAG): The number of connectable UEs was lower than usual, resulting in lower throughput. To resolve it, modifying the DU's code of MCS configuration resolved the issue. 
### response 3 (RAG)
- ref 3 (RAG): [sentence0_1](#sentence0_1)
- response 3 (RAG): The UE connection was difficult to establish, and the MCS assigned was low after connection, affecting throughput. To resolve it, correcting the gain settings on the DU resolved the problem.

## sentence0_1
The UE connection was difficult to establish. In addition, the MCS assigned was low after connection.

On investigation, it was found that the RX sensitivity was normal, but the gain settings on the DU procured from the new vendor were incorrect. This caused poor channel quality at all times, and finally resulted in the incident described at the beginning.

When the gain settings were made correct, the problem was resolved.
## sentence0_0
Throughput was not enough on UEs during test experiments. 
It has happened because a lower MCS was assigned by gNodeB as log showed. We reset UEs, but it recurred.
This was due to the channel quality being worse than expecte.

We moved UEs locatoion far from the initial field, then the issue finally resolved. The combination of the test field environment's terrain and UE's antenna configurations was found to be susceptible to frequency selectivity and have caused this event.
## sentence0_2
The number of connectable UEs was lower than usual.

Although the received power was sufficient, a lower MCS was assigned, which resulted in an unjustified occupation of the bandwidth.
This was due to an incorrect MCS setting in the DU of Vendor B, which had assigned a lower MCS. We modified the DU's code of MCS configuration, then the incident did not recur.

## sentence1_6
During the connection test, the DU stopped sending packets.
It was found that the PTP got unlocked.

When the number of UE connections or throughput increased, the process to handle those caused a memory overload and the PTP control program was in an error state. This caused issues.

The problem was addressed by implementing exlusive control of PTP control and data processing.

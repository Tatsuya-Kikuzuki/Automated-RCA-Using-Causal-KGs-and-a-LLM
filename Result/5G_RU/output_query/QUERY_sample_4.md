### response 1 (RAG)
- ref 1 (RAG): [sentence0_3](#sentence0_3)
- response 1 (RAG): CU-IP was not getting assigned in RU with v356 software. To resolve it, upgrade to software v359, where the issue has been fixed and CU-IP gets configured on RU correctly.

## sentence0_3
CU-IP was not getting assigned in RU with v356 software.
We observed PTP too was getting unlocked with v356 build.

5gdulls log shows "Software-Failure", which incicates the fact that RU could not catch the DHCP IP address correctly by the stacking of the software. In the v356 software, functionality of FQDN is developed partially and it conflicts with the DHCP function. It affects the PTP unlocked issue as well.

Issue has been fixed with software v359, Now CU-IP getting configured on RU and PTP unlocked issue cleared.

## sentence1_6
During the connection test, the DU stopped sending packets.
It was found that the PTP got unlocked.

When the number of UE connections or throughput increased, the process to handle those caused a memory overload and the PTP control program was in an error state. This caused issues.

The problem was addressed by implementing exlusive control of PTP control and data processing.

## sentence1_4
No Data was transmitted from DU.
It was observed that PTP and SyncE getting unlocked and those caused the incident.

According to 5gdulls logs, L1 was down. Need to check connection from DU to RU.

After replacing the v1 SFP with v2 SFP, PTP and SyncE got locked state successfully.
Here problem was not SFP itself, but it should be compatibility issue.
## sentence1_5
The DU failed to transmit data because PTP got unlocked.

We tried rebooting RU. Once RU is up, PTP gets locked and in 4 to 5 minutes goes unlocked state again, then no data is obserbed from DU.

Checked PTP accuracy and found that the PTP threshold for v201 software (±80 nsec) was too low, resulting in an unlocked state.
The issue was no longer observed after threshold of PTP accuracy was changed from 80ns to 1420ns in v206.

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) has failed during 256 QAM test.
It was caused by the RF power fluctuation and Constellation fluctuation inside RU.

RF power seems fluctuating and is unstable with all bandwidths and modulations.

RF power fluctuation Issue is not seen after replacing this RU. Observed issue with the old RU.
Environment and carrier configuration including cable connections and attenuators is exactly the same for both old RU and new RU. Observed that this is a HW issue and the amplifier is damaged on this unit.

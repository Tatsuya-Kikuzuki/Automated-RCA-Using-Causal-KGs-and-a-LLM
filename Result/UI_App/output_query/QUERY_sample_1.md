## Response (RAG)
### response 1 (RAG)
- ref 1 (RAG): [sentence0_5](#sentence0_5)
- response 1 (RAG): A loading error occurs when loading data for analysis. The reason was that numerical and textual data had been mixed. To resolve it, retry loading with only numerical data. 
### response 2 (RAG)
- ref 2 (RAG): [sentence0_4](#sentence0_4)
- response 2 (RAG): A loading error occurs when loading data for analysis. The version of the UI app had been updated to an incompatible version due to automatic updates. To resolve it, switch off automatic updates and ensure the UI app version is compatible. 
### response 3 (RAG)
- ref 3 (RAG): [sentence0_0](#sentence0_0)
- response 3 (RAG): Data for analysis could not be loaded due to a corrupted format in the header part of the data. To resolve it, overwrite the header part with that of normal data.

## sentence0_4
When trying to load data for analysis, a loading error occurs.

The version of the UI app had been updated to an incompatible version, which caused that data could not be loaded. The UI app version was updated on its own because automatic updates were switched on in the basic settings.
After switching off the setting of automatic updates, the loading error did not recur.
## sentence0_0
Data for analysis could not be loaded.

It was found that this was due to a corrupted format in the header part of the data.
The data could be read normally by overwriting the header part with that of normal data.

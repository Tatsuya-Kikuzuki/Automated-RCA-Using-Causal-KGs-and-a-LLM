## sentence0_2
Analysis process was interrupted midway through.

This was due to an unstable network environment.
Switching Wi-Fi environment to a wired NW enabled analysis.
## sentence1_1
The application was forcefully terminated immediately after start-up.

The version of the UI app had been updated to an incompatible version, which prevented the app from starting up properly. The reason for the incompatible versions was that the UI app had been downloaded via the internet.
After downloading it from within the company and reinstalling it, the version was set to the correct one and the system was able to start up.
## sentence1_2
Analysis process was interrupted midway through.

This was due to an unstable network environment.
Switching Wi-Fi environment to a wired NW enabled analysis.
## sentence1_4
When trying to load data for analysis, a loading error occurs.

The version of the UI app had been updated to an incompatible version, which caused that data could not be loaded. The UI app version was updated on its own because automatic updates were switched on in the basic settings.
After switching off the setting of automatic updates, the loading error did not recur.
## sentence1_0
Data for analysis could not be loaded.

It was found that this was due to a corrupted format in the header part of the data.
The data could be read normally by overwriting the header part with that of normal data.
## sentence1_3
The screen got stuck in the middle of a screen transition.

It was found that the unstable network environment was the cause of the screen getting stuck.
After improving the network environment and restarting the application, this phenomenon did not recur.

After switching off the setting of automatic updates, the loading error did not recur.
## sentence2_5
A loading error occurs when loading data for analysis.

The reason was that numerical and textual data had been mixed.
When a retry was made with only numerical data, the data could be loaded successfully.
## sentence2_3
